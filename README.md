# AJAX Control Toolkit â€“ Repository Archived

Dear Community,

As previously announced, the AJAX Control Toolkit repository has been archived as of today. This repository is now in a read-only state, meaning no new issues or pull requests will be accepted.

## Resources:

* The archived repository will remain accessible for reference purposes at [repository URL].
* For those looking to transition to modern technologies, we recommend exploring the ASP.NET Core framework and its associated libraries, which offer enhanced performance, security, and modern features.
  
Thank you once again for being a part of the AJAX Control Toolkit journey. We appreciate your support and contributions over the years.

Best regards,  
The DevExpress Team
